# Baldric Agent Instructions

Baldric is a Python implementation of Pi's minimalist coding-agent harness architecture. The goal is to develop it incrementally, with each phase clearly documented and tested.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Roadmap

The implementation roadmap is tracked in GitHub issue #2:

- https://github.com/Ember452/baldric/issues/2

Use that issue as the primary reference for phase ordering and architectural intent.

## Architecture Principles

Preserve Pi's core separation of concerns:

```text
AgentHarness = reusable agent brain
AgentSession = coding-agent environment
TUI = one possible frontend
```

Baldric should be organized around these layers:

```text
baldric_ai      provider/model streaming layer
baldric_agent   portable agent harness, loop, tools, events, sessions
baldric_coding  CLI app, resources, skills, extensions, commands, TUI integration
```

Keep the core agent package independent of CLI, Textual, Rich rendering, session file locations, and application-specific resource loading.

## TUI Direction

Use Textual for the full interactive TUI, but only behind an adapter boundary. The agent harness should emit events; UI layers should consume those events.

Early phases should prioritize:

1. print-mode CLI
2. Rich renderers
3. Textual interactive app

Do not let Textual become a dependency of the reusable agent harness.

## Development Workflow

- Work in small, documented phases.
- Keep changes aligned with the roadmap issue.
- Add or update docs when introducing architectural concepts.
- Add tests for behavior before expanding features.
- Run tests and Python commands through `uv` (for example, `uv run pytest` or `uv run python ...`) so they use the project environment.
- Prefer simple, explicit abstractions over framework-heavy designs.
- Keep commits atomic: one coherent feature, fix, docs update, refactor, or cleanup per commit.

## GitHub Issue and PR Formatting

- When creating or editing GitHub issues and pull requests from the CLI, write multiline Markdown bodies through a temporary file or heredoc and pass them with `--body-file`.
- Do not pass escaped newlines like `\n` inside quoted `--body` strings; GitHub will render them literally instead of as line breaks.
- Use Markdown headings, blank lines, bullets, and backticks for commands/paths so issue and PR descriptions are readable.
- After creating or editing a GitHub issue or PR body, verify the rendered source with `gh issue view ... --json body` or `gh pr view ... --json body` when practical.

## Python Guidelines

- Target the Python version declared in `pyproject.toml`.
- Prefer typed dataclasses or schema models for core messages, events, tools, and sessions.
- Keep async boundaries explicit.
- Use fake providers and fake tools for deterministic agent-loop tests.
- Avoid provider-specific assumptions in core agent code.

## Documentation Expectations

Each substantial phase should leave behind beginner-friendly notes under `dev-notes/` (build journals, design docs, ADRs), explaining:

- what was added
- why it exists
- how it maps to Pi's design
- how to test or use it

When a phase adds or changes user-facing behavior, also update the published docs
under `website/content/` (the "Use Baldric" guides and reference).
